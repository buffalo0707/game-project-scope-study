-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
    - The board will be represented as an array with 9 elements in JS.
    - When the game starts, every element in the array will be empty
    - When a player selects a space, the element with the corresponding index
      will be updated with the icon for that player.
    - Array iteration methods can be used after each move to determine if the
      game has been won
-   How you plan to approach this project.
    - I will tackle the project in order of the 'backlog' of user stories
    - For each story, I will tackle the first logical step then move from there
      in a logical order of small steps
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
    - JS will be contained in multiple files in an Assets/Scripts folder
    - Different files may include: user events, game events, user UI, game UI,
      game api, and user api
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
    - I'd like to add some smooth animated transitions between views
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
    - Commit early and often
    - Might try to work on multiple branches when possible
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
    - Yes?
